        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This easy cheesy lasagna recipe is a simple lasagna that takes about half the effort of traditional versions. I always make extra for leftovers, but the more I cook, the more they eat! Serve with garlic toast and salad.</p>

        <h3>Directions To Cook</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook ground beef and Italian sausage in a large skillet over medium-high heat until browned and crumbled; drain excess grease. Stir in olives and water; season with minced garlic, oregano, onion flakes, garlic powder, pepper, sage, and basil. Simmer, stirring frequently, about 15 minutes. Stir in marinara sauce and remove from the heat.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Spoon a layer of meat and sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Cover with a layer of dry noodles. Spread a thin layer of ricotta cheese over noodles; sprinkle with some mozzarella cheese. Cover with another layer of sauce; repeat layering, ending with meat and sauce on top. Reserve about 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese. </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, checking after 30 minutes. Lasagna is cooked when it's easily pierced with a knife. Sprinkle reserved mozzarella cheese over lasagna and bake until melted, about 10 minutes more</li>
