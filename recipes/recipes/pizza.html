            <h3>Directions To Cook</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven's broiler. If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while it preheats.</li>
                <li>In a food processor, combine the avocados and cilantro. Puree while adding lime juice and salt to taste. Cover, and set aside.</li>
                <li>Slice the garlic clove in half, and rub the cut side onto the tops of the pizza crusts for flavor.Brush both sides of the crusts with olive oil. <br />
                    Spread the avocado mixture thickly over the top of each crust, then arrange chicken and tomatoes on top. Sprinkle with cheese, and season lightly with cayenne pepper.<br />
                    Place pizzas on a baking sheet if you do not have a pizza stone.</li>
                <li>Broil for about 5 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the cheese has just melted and the crust is lightly toasted.</li>
