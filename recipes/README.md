# 🍽️ Odin Recipes Project

A simple **HTML-only** website showcasing various recipes. Built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/foundations/projects/recipes) Foundations Course. 🧑‍🍳

This project helped me practice **HTML structure**, **semantic tags**, **links**, and **lists** — all without any CSS or JavaScript. It's the perfect starting point for beginners to get hands-on experience with writing clean, semantic HTML.



## 🧱 What You'll Find

- `index.html` – The main homepage listing all recipe links.
- `/recipes/` folder containing:
  - `lasagna.html`
  - `pizza.html`
  - `salad.html`

Each recipe page includes:
- A heading with the dish name 🥘  
- An image (from the web) 🖼️  
- A description 📝  
- Ingredients listed in an unordered list (`<ul>`) 📋  
- Preparation steps in an ordered list (`<ol>`) 🔢  
- A link back to the homepage 🏠  



## 📁 Folder Structure

```
recipes/
├── README.md
├── index.html
└── recipes/
    ├── lasagna.html
    ├── pizza.html
    └── salad.html
```



## 🔧 Technologies Used
